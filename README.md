Thank you for taking time to checkout The Indi Hub Webring.

In the event of updates, I will publish them here. The remote CDN script will update automatically. The plugin might not. (*for now at least*) 

# Wordpress Plugin
This is the Wordppress Plugin, simple enough

 1. Register and add your site at https://theindihub.org you can grab the plugin and install Or apply the code manually *(depends on your level of expertise)* 
 3. If using the plugin: Install as normal and go to the settings->indihub-webring page.
 4. You need to enter: user_id, security_token, site_id
 5. Hit save
 6. Add the shortcode `[indihub_webring]` to a post, page, or widget.  

Once your site has been approved and added the Webring navigation will show where you added the code. An email will be sent to you when it has been approved, and we aim to make you wait as least as possible.
